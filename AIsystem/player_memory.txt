- Relocates frequently across map edges; avoids center positioning, prefers perimeter movement.
- Continuous spraying with minimal bursting; shoots while moving at predicted intercepts.
- Highly reactive dodging perpendicular to incoming threats; anticipates bullet trajectories well.
- Gravitates toward map corners and walls (north, west, south edges consistently).
- Predictable diagonal/linear movement patterns allow successful interception; struggles against aggressive gap-closing.

- Stationary camping initially, then shifted to high-speed diagonal/directional sprints unpredictably
- Continuous spray fire with minimal precision; relied on volume over accuracy
- No visible dodging; maintained committed movement patterns despite incoming fire
- Started map edges/periphery, moved toward center as engagement progressed
- Predictable velocity made interception easy; failed to vary speed or direction

- Constant movement across map with predictable diagonal/linear trajectories; minimal camping
- Continuous spray shooting; no burst control or patient aim discipline observed
- Minimal reactive dodging; occasional late perpendicular evasion but generally stationary targets
- Favors map edges and corners; trapped near walls multiple times during pursuit
- Predictable pathing allows pre-aiming; slow repositioning when caught at map extremities

- Aggressive rushing and constant forward momentum toward opponent; minimal camping or defensive positioning.
- Continuous spray fire at close range; no burst control or patient aim discipline observed.
- Predictable linear movement patterns; AI successfully predicted intercept positions repeatedly throughout match.
- Favours map centre and diagonal movement; occasionally trapped near edges during retreats.
- Telegraphed trajectories make interception trivial; lacks erratic strafing to break AI's prediction accuracy.

- Constantly mobile, moving horizontally across map center; rarely camps or holds ground
- Continuous spray fire when weapon ready; aggressive volume-based damage approach, minimal patience
- Reactive dodging only when bullets close (~120px); poor anticipation of incoming threats
- Prefers open center-map positioning; gets trapped at edges, avoids corner holds
- Predictable linear paths allow easy interception; vulnerable to ambush during reloads
